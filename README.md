# EDAP10

These are the labs from the course EDAP10, multithreaded programming. This is not my favourite course only because the lecturer made brilliant 
animations showing your code in practicality, but also because multithreading is so much fun. 
What we had to work with was basically the actors of the program; the platform in "twits", the different components in "wash" etc.
Different labs teaches us a new way of attaining thread safety, which you will see. To see the program executing, just run the main class
and the animation will show you the execution. Of course the code powering the programs is available for reviewing.
